<h1>About me!</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Marc, I'm a 31 years old and I live in Copenhagen, Denmark. I have always enjoyed creating things online and explore my creativity. So after a minor deroute into the world of marketing I decided to take some classes to see what all this UI/UX was about.</p> 
<p>This really intrigued my interest so I decided to take classes in Photoshop, Illustrator and After Effects aswell but meanwhile my brother was finishing his degree in multimedia design and watching him being taught HTML and CSS really made my realize that coding was my way to go!</p> 
<p>Fast forward a few years and now I'm studying multimedia design, with a focus on frontend development and I can't wait to learn more and improve my skills within HTML, CSS and Javascript. After finishing my current study, my plan is to carry on learning and study the bachelor degree in Web Development.</p>
<p>When I'm not sat infront of the computer coding like a mad man, I spent a lot of my time playing sports and in particular football is a massive interest of mine, where I eagerly watch all the games I can and follow my favorite teams around Europe.</p>
